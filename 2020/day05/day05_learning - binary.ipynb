    "#### Solving with Binary\n",
    "\n",
    "The code above converts all of the input data to binary, so will break down for myself what is happening. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can take an example provided us -  `FBFBBFFRLR:`\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "F means take the lower half\n",
    "B means take the upper half\n",

    "#### Base 2 vs Base 10\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary / base 2 has a different meaning than decimal / base 10. \n",
    "\n",
    "In base 10 each digit in a number represents 1 of 10 sections (`values of 0-9`). \n",
    "For example `056` tells us: \n",
    "- `0`: We are in the 000s. \n",
    "- `5`: We are in the 50s. \n",
    "- `6`: We are in the 10s, but this actually provides our actual number. \n",
    "\n",
    "base 2 does the same, but each digit is going to represent 1 of 2 sections (`values of 0-1`), which makes it a great candidate for splitting in half!\n",
    "\n",
    "For example `010`: \n",
    "- Firstly, since this is three digits this number can only be 0 - 7 (`2*3` = `8` possible values)\n",
    "- `Leftmost 0`: This represents numbers 0-3. If it were 1 then this would be 4-7. \n",
    "- `Middle 1`: This value changes based on the value to left. \n",
    "    - If left were 0 & this is 1 then we have options of: `2-3`\n",
    "    - If left were 1 & this is 1 then we have options of: `3-4`\n",
    "- `Rightmost 0`: This is our last value & determines our number. In this case we take the lower bound, which yields `2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Full binary breakdown: \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "000 = 0\n",
    "001 = 1\n",
    "010 = 2\n",
    "011 = 3\n",
    "100 = 4\n",
    "101 = 5\n",
    "110 = 6\n",
    "111 = 7\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Using the above for solving the problem: \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's return to our test case:  `FBFBBFF`\n",
    "- Min row = 0\n",
    "- Max row = 127\n",
    "- Expected row: `44`\n",
    "\n",
    "Breaking it down from left to right: \n",
    "- `F` -> 0: 0 - 63\n",
