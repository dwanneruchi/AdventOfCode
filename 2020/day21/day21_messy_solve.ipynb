    "### Day 21, Pt 1 - Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "This is my \"night of\" solve and could use a lot of work. Mainly was figuring out how to solve the logic by hand, then write code as I went. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### What we know:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Each allergen is found in exactly one ingredient. \n",
    "2) Each ingredient contains zero or one allergen. \n",
    "    - Allergens are not always marked \n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Test Case Interpretation: \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "mxmxvkd kfcds sqjhc nhms (contains dairy, fish)\n",
    "trh fvjkl sbzzf mxmxvkd (contains dairy)\n",
    "sqjhc fvjkl (contains soy)\n",
    "sqjhc mxmxvkd sbzzf (contains fish)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Allergens:\n",
    "- We can determine that `mxmxvkd` contains dairy based on it existing in line 1 & line 2. \n",
    "- We can determine that `sqjhc` could contain fish or soy.\n",
    "- We can determine that `fvjkl` could contain soy.\n",
    "\n",
    "No allergens:\n",
    "- `kfcds` & `nhms` only appear in line 1, so no allergen (`mxmxvkd` has already taken dairy)\n",
    "- `trh` only in line 2, so no allergen (`mxmxvkd` has already taken dairy)\n",
    "- `sbzzf` appears in various spots, but can't logically have an allergen:\n",
    "    - It is in line 2, but can't have dairy.\n",
    "    - It is line 4, but given line 2 we know it can't be linked to fish since the item linked to fish would need to have been present in line 1. "
