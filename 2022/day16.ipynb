    "- once a valve is open it released `p` every minute. This was not initially clear!\n",
    "- the DFS approach I copied is able to handle backtracking since it is always looking at all neighbors: \n",
    "    - Assume I have `AA` connected to `BB,CC` and `BB` connected to `EE`.\n",
    "    - At `AA` I will consider the following:\n",
    "        - opening to valve `AA` (a one-time step)\n",
    "        - moving to `BB`\n",
    "        - moving to `CC`\n",
    "    - Let's say I move to `BB`, then my options are:\n",

    "        - move to `EE` \n",
    "        - move to `AA` -> we could keep bouncing back and forth, of course we will also take all other routes to 30 in this case."
