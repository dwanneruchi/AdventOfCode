I eventually reread `\"Locations of height 9 do not count as being in any basin, and all other locations will always be part of exactly one basin.\"` Assumed in here is that input data will segment properly so that 9s and general boundary can be used to ensure no duplicates across basins so I didn't even bother checking for that. \n",
