    "I will admit I got stumped by the \"infinite sequence\" aspect of this problem. I ended up looking online for a hint, and once I saw that hint it became very clear how to solve this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Solving Infinite Headache:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each step our matrix will increase by 1 in every direction, meaning we shift from `(n) x (n)` to `(n + 2) x (n+2)`\n",
    "- Initially we need to determine our boundary outside our input matrix:\n",
    "    - For our actual input data our algorithm starts as follows: `#.#.##...###...`\n",
    "    - This means that any value decoded to be `0` will be marked `#`. Given our \"infinite boundary\" is all `.` (int `0`) to start, it means in our next step (an odd step) all infinity converts to a `#` (represented by int 1). \n",
    "    - However, on our next step the surrounding points of an infinite point are all `#`, which means the bit sequence is `111111111`, which converts to `511`. This means we take the last point of our algorithm, which ends with `######.....`. This means after an even step any infinite space needs to be shifted to a `.`\n",
    "- Once we have figured the above out we can move step by step, making sure we properly turn on and off our infinite sequences (limited to boundaries that impact our ever expanding matrix)\n",
    "    - Each step I strip away the extra padding and replace with the proper infinite sequence type\n",
    "    - For odd steps (1st, 3rd, etc.) this means using a pad of `0` to represent `.`\n",
    "    - For even steps I use a pad of `1` to represent `#`"
