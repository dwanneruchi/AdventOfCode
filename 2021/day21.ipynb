    "Our problem expands as follows:\n",
    "- We now have a quantum 3-sided dice (values 1,2,3)\n",
    "- each roll splits off into its own universe -> one where the roll is 1, one where it was 2, and one where it was 3.\n",
    "    - If we do the math (and I failed to initially!) this means each sequence of 3 rolls can yield 3 x 3 x 3 combinations, or 27 total variants.\n",
    "    - Some of these variants will repeat in sum (min is 3, max is 9)\n",
    "- The game plays the same as before, except we now only play until someone hits 21\n",
    "\n",
    "In how many universes does the player with more wins win out?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Problem Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially I started solving by keeping track of likelihoods of each state, where a state was the following: `{p1 position, p1 score, p2 position, and p2 score}`. \n",
    "- I quickly moved away from tracking likelihoods to just keeping counts. \n",
    "- The reason for this is I was converting likelihoods into frequency distributions anyways, so no point in worrying about conversion based on expected universes. \n",
    "\n",
    "I have a function that takes in the current `state` of a game as well as the `count`.\n",
    "- The count is how many of these states exist across all universes - I keep tabs on this by using a `defaultdict` and making the `key` the `state`. \n",
    "- Depending on which player rolled, each initial state will output 27 states (all combinations of rolls), updating the `position` and `score` of the player that rolled.\n",
    "- These states have a `count`, which will be added back to the general dictionary keeping tabs on states.m\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of a step, I check the state dictionary to see if any of the keys indicate a player has hit or exceeded 21. In the event that they do, I remove this from future steps and add to the players overall winnings. "
